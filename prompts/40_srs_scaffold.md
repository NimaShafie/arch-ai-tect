Using the requirements brief and generated diagrams as context, draft a succinct SRS (Markdown):
- Introduction, Stakeholders, Glossary
- Overall Description (user classes, assumptions/constraints)
- Functional Requirements (feature groups)
- External Interfaces (web/api/data/integrations)
- Nonfunctional Requirements (targets, security, privacy)
- Acceptance Criteria (per feature cluster)
Target 2–4 pages. No code fence.
