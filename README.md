ArchAItect helps software architects and engineering teams move from **concept to structured design** faster than ever.  
Using a combination of local and agentic AI tools, ArchAItect generates key software architecture deliverables:
- System context and use-case diagrams  
- Component, sequence, and deployment charts  
- Architectural decision records (ADRs)  
- Traceable documentation for developers  

**Why ArchAItect?**
- Saves hours of manual diagramming and document prep  
- Integrates with Markdown, MkDocs, or other doc systems  
- Works locally via Docker with Ollama and Open-WebUI for privacy-safe AI workflows
